            <h1>A.P.J Abdul Kalam(1931-2015)</h1>
            <h2>“Dream, Dream Dream <br>
                Dreams transform into thoughts <br>
                And thoughts result in action.”</h2>

            <p class="para" style="color: #484773; margin-top: 50px; margin-left: 10px;">A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full
                Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, (born October 15, 1931, Rameswaram, India—died July 27, 2015,
                Shillong), Indian scientist and politician who played a leading role in the development of India’s
                missile and nuclear weapons programs. He was president of India from 2002 to 2007.<br>

            <p style="color: #484773; margin-left: 10px;"> He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science
                administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space
                Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and
                military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his
                work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a
                pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the
                first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
                Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya
                Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's
                President", he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single
                term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest
                civilian honour.</p>
            <p style="color: #484773; margin-left: 10px;">In his lifetime, he published several works, including Agni ki Udaan (1999), India 2020 (1998), Ignited
                Minds (2002), Naa Jeevana Gamanam (2013), Turning Points: A Journey Across Difficulties (2012),
                Indominate Spirit (2006), and You Are Born To Blossom (2007). (2008). You can include them in the APJ
                Abdul Kalam Essay and some other writers. They have devoted books to him, including APJ Abdul Kalam by
                Arun Tiwari and Advantage of India by Srijan Pal Singh.</p>
            <p style="color: #484773; margin-left: 10px;">While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from
                an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.Thousands, including national-level dignitaries,
                attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state
                honours.</p>
